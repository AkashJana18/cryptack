#  Cryptack - Only CryptoTracker you need!

## Description
CryptoTracker is the tracker you always needed. Compare different cryptocurrencies, view their graphsâ€”prices, total volumes, market cap, etc. Search from the top 100 cryptocurrencies in real-time and add them to your watchlist as well.

## Objective
To build a responsive and live crypto tracker using React JS.

## Technologies Used
1. **React JS** - for frontend
2. **Material UI** - for components
3. **Chart.js** - for different graphs
4. **Axios** - to make API calls
5. **React Router** - for routing
6. **Coingecko API** - to fetch coin data
7. **Framer Motion** - for animations

## Project Context
The entire world is moving towards Web3 and crypto. Staying up to date with all cryptocurrencies can be challenging. Use CryptoTracker to analyze, compare, and learn about different cryptocurrencies, all in one place. This tool is designed to help users make informed decisions by providing real-time data and interactive features.

## Project Stages
1. **Basic React Project Setup**
   - Walkthrough of what we'll be building.
   - Review Coingecko API documentation.
2. **Setting Up Folder Structure**
   - Add global styling, fonts, root variables, etc.
   - Integrate React Router.
3. **Making the Header**
   - Add MUI drawer as the mobile navbar.
4. **Making Landing Page Components**
5. **Making the Dashboard Page**
   - Add MUI tabs to the project.
6. **Fetching Coin Data**
   - Call the Coingecko API to fetch coin data.
7. **Creating Grid and List Views**
8. **Developing Coin Page**
9. **Integrating Chart.js**
   - Add Chart.js to the coin page for visualizations.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
